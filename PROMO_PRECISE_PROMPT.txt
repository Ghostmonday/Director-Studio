DIRECTORSTUIO PROMO - PRECISE TECHNICAL PROMPT FOR POLLO AI
================================================================

INSTRUCTION: Animate this mobile app screenshot with cinematic camera movements while preserving ALL UI elements, text, and interface clarity.

SOURCE IMAGE: Screenshot of DirectorStudio iOS app - main text entry interface

UI ELEMENTS TO PRESERVE (Keep 100% readable):
- App title "DirectorStudio" at top
- Navigation tabs at bottom
- Primary text input field (large text area for screenplay/story entry)
- Any placeholder text like "Enter your story..." or "Paste screenplay here..."
- Toggle switches for pipeline stages (Segmentation, Enhancement, Continuity, etc.)
- "Generate Clip" button or similar CTA
- Any icons, labels, or UI chrome

CAMERA MOVEMENT SEQUENCE (15-20 seconds):
1. Start: Slight push-in from medium shot, centered on the text input field
2. Hold for 2-3 seconds establishing the interface
3. Gentle pan down revealing the pipeline stage toggles
4. Subtle zoom emphasizing the creative power of the tool
5. Slow rack focus from top to bottom of screen
6. Final push-in on the Generate button suggesting action
7. End: Hold on full interface view with slight depth of field

LIGHTING & ATMOSPHERE:
- Warm, inviting color temperature (3200-4500K feel)
- Soft key light from top-left creating gentle shadows
- Slight rim light on edges of UI elements for depth
- Subtle lens flares when camera moves (not overdone - professional)
- Film grain: 15% opacity for cinematic texture
- Slight vignette (10-15%) to focus attention
- Color grade: Slightly desaturated with lifted blacks (modern tech commercial look)

MOTION & DYNAMICS:
- Camera movement: Smooth, stabilized, professional gimbal quality
- Speed: Slow, deliberate (cinematic 24fps feel even at 30fps)
- UI elements: Subtle parallax depth (text layers slightly separate from background)
- Screen glow: Gentle emission from the interface suggesting it's a live screen
- Ambient particles: Very subtle floating particles suggesting creativity/magic (5% opacity max)

TEXT CLARITY REQUIREMENTS:
- ALL on-screen text must remain 100% sharp and readable
- No motion blur on UI elements or text
- Maintain crisp edges on buttons, toggles, and input fields
- Preserve app iconography and symbols

STYLE REFERENCES:
- Apple WWDC app reveal cinematics
- Modern SaaS product demo (Linear, Notion, Figma style)
- NOT flashy or over-edited
- Professional, clean, inspiring
- Tech commercial meets film production quality

MOOD & ENERGY:
- Inspiring without being cheesy
- Professional without being cold
- Creative possibility
- Accessible power
- "This is where stories become cinema"

TECHNICAL SPECS:
- Maintain 1920x1080 or source aspect ratio
- 30fps for smooth motion
- High bitrate/quality - no compression artifacts on UI elements
- Preserve UI contrast ratios for accessibility

DO NOT:
- Add fake UI elements not in the source image
- Distort or warp the screen/text
- Over-animate (keep it subtle and professional)
- Add tacky effects (no explosions, excessive particles, etc.)
- Obscure any text or UI elements
- Change colors of the original UI (enhance, don't replace)

FINAL NOTE: This is a real app screenshot showing real functionality. The animation should enhance and showcase the interface, not distract from it. Every element visible in the original image has purpose and should remain clear and readable throughout the entire video.
