# Error Messaging Improvements - Default & 200 OK Handling

## Summary

Enhanced error messaging throughout the API layer to provide user-friendly messages for common scenarios, especially 200 OK responses with unexpected formats.

---

## ‚úÖ Improvements Made

### 1. **200 OK Error Handling**

**Before**:
- "Unexpected response format - missing videoUrl"
- "Empty response from server - Check API endpoint and request format"

**After**:
- "Video generation completed, but the video URL was not returned. The service may be experiencing issues. Please try again."
- "The server returned an empty response. This may be a temporary issue. Please try again."

**Location**: `APIClient.swift` - `errorDescription` property

---

### 2. **404 Status Endpoint Errors**

**Before**:
- "Task not found after 36s - task may not exist or API endpoint issue. Task ID: ..."

**After**:
- "The video generation task could not be found after 36 seconds. This appears to be a Pollo API issue with their status endpoint. Please try again. If the problem persists, contact support. Task ID: ..."

**Location**: `PolloAIService.swift` - Fast-fail timeout handler

---

### 3. **Default Error Messages**

**Added user-friendly messages for**:

| Error Type | Before | After |
|------------|--------|-------|
| **200 OK unexpected format** | "HTTP 200: Request failed" | "The server responded successfully, but the response format was unexpected. Please try again." |
| **Decoding Error** | "JSON Decode: [technical error]" | "The server response could not be understood. This may be a temporary issue. Please try again." |
| **Network Error** | "Network: [technical error]" | "Network connection failed. Please check your internet connection and try again." |
| **Auth Error (API key)** | "Auth: [technical message]" | "API key error. Please check your API keys in Settings." |
| **Empty Response (200)** | "Empty response from server - Check API endpoint..." | "The server returned an empty response. This may be a temporary issue. Please try again." |

**Location**: `APIClient.swift` - `errorDescription` property

---

### 4. **User-Friendly Titles**

**Added context-aware titles**:

| Scenario | Title |
|----------|-------|
| Missing videoUrl (200 OK) | "Video Not Available" |
| Task not found (404) | "Service Temporarily Unavailable" |
| Empty response (200) | "Connection Issue" |
| Decoding error | "Response Error" |
| API key issues | "API Key Issue" |

**Location**: `APIClient.swift` - `userFriendlyTitle` property

---

## üìã Error Message Flow

### Example: 200 OK with Missing videoUrl

1. **Service Layer** (`PolloAIService.swift`):
   ```swift
   throw APIError.invalidResponse(
       statusCode: 200, 
       message: "Video generation completed, but the video URL was not returned. This may be a temporary API issue. Please try again."
   )
   ```

2. **Error Description** (`APIClient.swift`):
   - Detects "missing videoUrl" in message
   - Returns user-friendly message: "Video generation completed, but the video URL was not returned. The service may be experiencing issues. Please try again."

3. **User-Friendly Title**:
   - Returns: "Video Not Available"

4. **UI Display**:
   - Title: "Video Not Available"
   - Message: "Video generation completed, but the video URL was not returned. The service may be experiencing issues. Please try again."

---

## üîç Message Detection Logic

The `errorDescription` property now intelligently detects technical messages and converts them to user-friendly versions:

### Pattern Matching:

1. **"missing videoUrl" or "Unexpected response format"**:
   ‚Üí "Video generation completed, but the video URL was not returned..."

2. **"Task not found after" + "task may not exist or API endpoint issue"**:
   ‚Üí "The video generation task could not be found. This may be a temporary API issue..."

3. **"Empty response"**:
   ‚Üí "The server returned an empty response. Please check your connection..."

4. **Auth errors containing "API key"**:
   ‚Üí "API key error. Please check your API keys in Settings."
