# üí¨ Dialogue Implantation Feature

## Overview

I've implemented **Dialogue Implantation** - a powerful new feature that automatically adds natural, contextual dialogue to scenes that don't have any. This transforms silent narratives into talking scenes!

## How It Works

### 1. **Detection**
When processing segments, the AI analyzes each scene to determine if it contains dialogue:
- Looks for quotation marks, character names with colons, etc.
- If no dialogue is found, it's marked as a candidate for implantation

### 2. **Character Identification**
The AI intelligently identifies who should speak based on:
- Characters mentioned in the scene description
- Context clues (e.g., "a young woman", "the detective", "the crowd")
- Scene type and setting

### 3. **Dialogue Generation**
The AI creates 1-3 short, natural lines that:
- Fit the scene's mood and context
- Reveal character traits
- Advance the story
- Enhance emotional impact

## Examples

### Silent Scene ‚Üí Dialogue Added

**BEFORE:**
> "A young woman walks into a coffee shop and orders her usual drink."

**AFTER:**
> "A young woman in a rain-soaked jacket pushes through the coffee shop door, the bell chiming softly. She approaches the counter with tired eyes.
> 
> Barista: 'The usual, Sarah? Double shot, no foam?'
> 
> Sarah: 'Make it a triple today.' She manages a weak smile. 'It's been one of those mornings.'"

### Action Scene ‚Üí Dynamic Dialogue

**BEFORE:**
> "The detective chases the suspect through the alley."

**AFTER:**
> "The detective sprints through the narrow alley, his coat billowing behind him. Trash cans clatter as the suspect knocks them over.
> 
> Detective: 'Stop! There's nowhere to run!'
> 
> The suspect glances back, panic in his eyes.
> 
> Suspect: 'You don't understand! They'll kill me!'"

### Emotional Scene ‚Üí Character Expression

**BEFORE:**
> "She reads the letter and becomes emotional."

**AFTER:**
> "Her trembling hands unfold the yellowed letter, tears welling up as she reads.
> 
> She whispers: 'After all these years... you kept your promise.'
> 
> Her fingers trace the faded ink as a sob escapes: 'I'm so sorry I doubted you.'"

## Settings

In the Segmentation Config screen, you'll see:

### **üó£Ô∏è Dialogue Implantation** (ON by default)
- **Toggle**: Enable/disable automatic dialogue addition
- **Style**: Inherits from the selected expansion style:
  - **Vivid**: Natural, descriptive dialogue
  - **Emotional**: Feeling-focused dialogue
  - **Action**: Sharp, urgent exchanges
  - **Atmospheric**: Mood-enhancing dialogue
  - **Balanced**: Mix of all styles

## Technical Implementation

1. **Expansion Prompt Enhanced**: Added specific instructions for dialogue detection and generation
2. **All Segments Expanded**: Changed logic so every segment gets processed (not just short/emotional ones)
3. **Logging**: Added "üí¨ [Dialogue Implanted]" messages to track when dialogue is added

## Benefits

- **Brings Stories to Life**: Silent descriptions become dramatic scenes
- **Character Development**: Dialogue reveals personality and motivation
- **Emotional Impact**: Characters can express feelings directly
- **Better Videos**: Video generation AI performs better with dialogue cues

## Usage Tips

1. **Write Silent First**: Just describe what happens - let AI add the dialogue
2. **Trust the Context**: AI understands scene mood and generates appropriate dialogue
3. **Review & Refine**: Check the generated dialogue in the segment editor
4. **Mix & Match**: Some scenes work better silent - you can toggle per segment

## Example Test Script

Try this silent story and watch it come alive:

```
A private investigator enters his dimly lit office late at night. 

He notices his desk drawer is slightly open. Someone has been here.

He finds a photograph of a woman he hasn't seen in years.

His phone rings. He hesitates before answering.

The voice on the other end delivers a warning about the past catching up.

He hangs up and stares at the photograph, making a difficult decision.
```

Each segment will get contextual dialogue that builds suspense and reveals character!
