UX/UI prompt for an iPhone-first storage launch screen (Supabase-aware)
You are a senior mobile product designer and iOS engineer. Design an iPhone-first, visually elegant storage launch experience that unifies Local (on-device), Cloud (iCloud/Files), and Backend (Supabase) storage; the design must be optimized for one-handed/thumb reach, App Store feature-readiness, and macOS compatibility. Deliver a complete UX/UI package that references the provided Supabase schema (clip_jobs, scene_drafts, screenplays, continuity_* tables, credits_ledger, project_overview, video_uploads, user_statistics) and includes integration notes for pipelines and realtime sync. Provide the following deliverables exactly: 1) a one-paragraph product goal and success metrics; 2) an annotated high-fidelity layout description for an iPhone launch screen (compact and expanded states) with explicit thumb-reach zones and 44x44 tap targets; 3) interaction flows for Local / Cloud / Backend segmented control including animated transition specs and failure/resolution states; 4) a privacy-first auth and Supabase integration plan mapping to schema tables (auth flows, Keychain storage, token refresh, realtime subscriptions for clip_jobs/video_uploads, queued writes to scene_drafts and credits_ledger, conflict resolution policies tied to continuity_scene_states and continuity_logs); 5) accessibility, localization, and App Store feature checklist (entitlements, privacy strings, macCatalyst notes); 6) three onboarding microcopy variants (concise, friendly, premium) and key analytic event names matching your telemetry plan (storage.open, storage.sync.started, storage.sync.completed, storage.conflict.resolved).

Design constraints and implementation priorities (include these explicitly in the outputs):

Aesthetic: minimal, tactile, generous spacing, subtle depth, color tokens for affordance.

Performance: local-first UX showing cached items in â‰¤150 ms; background prefetch from Supabase and iCloud with skeleton states.

Resilience: offline reads, queued backend writes with idempotency keys, realtime updates via Supabase Realtime with polling fallback, clear conflict-resolution UI referencing continuity_scene_states/continuity_logs schema.

Security & Privacy: only opt-in telemetry; store Supabase tokens in Keychain; never expose service_role keys client-side; use Row-Level Security and server-side RPCs for privileged operations.

Pipeline & CI/CD: include notes for schema migrations, staging Supabase instance for integration tests, snapshot tests for major UI states, and feature-flag rollout strategy for App Store staged release.
