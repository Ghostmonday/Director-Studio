# ðŸŽ¬ Semantic Expansion: Before & After

## What Just Changed

I've enabled **Semantic Expansion** by default! Now the segmentation module doesn't just split your text - it **re-articulates** each segment into vivid, cinematic descriptions.

## Examples of Re-Articulation

### Example 1: Simple Action
**BEFORE (Your Original Text):**
> "A detective enters a dimly lit office."

**AFTER (Re-Articulated with Vivid Style):**
> "A weathered detective pushes through heavy oak doors into a noir-drenched office. Venetian blind shadows slice across dusty air as amber light from a dying desk lamp reveals stacks of forgotten case files. His silhouette fills the doorframe, fedora tilted, casting long shadows across checkered linoleum."

### Example 2: Emotional Scene  
**BEFORE:**
> "She reads the letter and cries."

**AFTER (Re-Articulated with Emotional Style):**
> "Trembling fingers unfold the worn parchment as her eyes scan each word. The letter shakes in her grasp, tears blurring the ink. Her face crumbles, shoulders heaving with silent sobs that echo in the empty room. The paper falls from her hands, floating like a dying leaf."

### Example 3: Action Sequence
**BEFORE:**
> "They fight in the warehouse."

**AFTER (Re-Articulated with Action Style):**
> "Fists collide in the industrial maze of the warehouse. Bodies crash through wooden crates, splinters exploding in slow motion. A spinning kick sends one fighter careening into steel shelving, tools clattering like metallic rain. They circle each other between towering containers, sweat glistening under flickering fluorescents."

## The 5 Expansion Styles

1. **Vivid & Cinematic** - Emphasizes colors, lighting, textures, cinematic framing
2. **Emotionally Expressive** - Focuses on feelings, internal states, psychological depth
3. **Action-Oriented** - Highlights movement, energy, dynamic choreography
4. **Atmospheric** - Builds mood through environment, ambiance, sensory details
5. **Balanced** - Blends all aspects into cohesive cinematic descriptions

## What This Means for Your Videos

- **Richer Visuals**: AI video generation gets more detailed instructions
- **Better Continuity**: Enhanced descriptions maintain visual consistency
- **Emotional Depth**: Scenes convey the intended mood more effectively
- **Professional Quality**: Output resembles actual film scripts
