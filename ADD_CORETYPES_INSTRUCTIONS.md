# 🚨 CRITICAL: CoreTypes.swift Missing from Xcode Project

## The Problem
`CoreTypes.swift` contains all the core types, protocols, and enums:
- `AIServiceProtocol`
- `PipelineError`
- `VideoStyle`
- `StoryAnalysisOutput`
- `Project`
- And more...

**This file exists on disk but is NOT in the Xcode project!**

## The Solution

### In Xcode:

1. **Right-click on `CoreTypes` folder** (or create it if it doesn't exist)
2. Choose **"Add Files to DirectorStudio..."**
3. Navigate to: `DirectorStudio/CoreTypes/CoreTypes.swift`
4. ✅ Make sure **"Add to targets: DirectorStudio"** is checked
5. ✅ Choose **"Create groups"** (not folder references)
6. Click **"Add"**

### Files You Need to Add:

```
DirectorStudio/
  ├── CoreTypes/
  │   └── CoreTypes.swift ⚠️ ADD THIS!
  └── Services/
      ├── ContinuityManager.swift ⚠️ ADD THIS TOO!
      ├── PolloAIService.swift ✅ Already in project
      └── DeepSeekAIService.swift ✅ Already in project
```

### After Adding:

1. Hit **⌘+B** to build
2. All errors should disappear!
3. You'll only have the code signing warning left

## Why This Matters

Without CoreTypes.swift:
- ❌ No AIServiceProtocol
- ❌ No PipelineError
- ❌ No VideoStyle
- ❌ Services can't compile
- ❌ App won't build

With CoreTypes.swift:
- ✅ All types available
- ✅ Services compile
- ✅ App builds successfully

## Do This NOW! 🎯
