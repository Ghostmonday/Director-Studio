## 🔧 Issues Resolved

### Issue 1: CloudKit Crash (FIXED)
**Problem:** App crashed on init trying to access `CKContainer.default()`  
**Solution:** Made container lazy with simulator detection
```swift
#if targetEnvironment(simulator)
return nil  // Skip CloudKit in simulator
#else
return CKContainer.default()
#endif
```

### Issue 2: Missing Assets (FIXED)
**Problem:** No Assets.xcassets in project  
**Solution:** Added Assets.xcassets with proper structure

### Issue 3: macOS Compatibility (FIXED)
**Problem:** iOS-specific APIs breaking macOS build  
**Solution:** Added `#if os(iOS)` guards for platform-specific code
