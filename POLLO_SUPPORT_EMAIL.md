Subject: üö® API Task Status Endpoint Returns 404 ‚Äî Request for Confirmation

Hello Pollo AI Support Team,

I'm integrating the Pollo API into a production-level Swift/iOS application called DirectorStudio, built by Neural Draft LLC.
We've confirmed that task creation works as expected, but the status polling endpoint consistently returns 404, even for newly created tasks.

Details

API Key (masked): pollo_wR53NAgcFqBTzPAaggCoQtQBvyusFBSPMfyujBdoCfkn
Environment: macOS Terminal / cURL

Generation Endpoint (working):
POST https://pollo.ai/api/platform/generation/pollo/pollo-v1-6

Status Endpoint (failing):
GET https://pollo.ai/api/platform/generation/task/status/{taskId}

Test Task IDs:

cmhdugtn008iw142oungth0my

cmhdukfgf09t0ycyfydkjtoli

Behavior:

Task creation succeeds and returns a valid taskId.

All tested variations (/task/status/{id}, /task/{id}, /generation/task/{id}) return 404 immediately or even after 60+ seconds.

Verified across multiple fresh tasks and repeated runs.

Questions

Is the /task/status/{taskId} endpoint still active or has it been updated?

Is there a delay or alternate route for task availability (e.g., webhook or different polling path)?

Are there any API scope or permission changes affecting pollo-v1-6?

Could you confirm the expected response structure and polling method for active tasks?

Impact

This behavior currently blocks automated task monitoring and indexing within DirectorStudio's production pipeline. We're holding deployment until this is clarified.

Thank you for your help.
Please confirm whether this endpoint has changed or provide the correct path for current API versions.

Warm regards,
