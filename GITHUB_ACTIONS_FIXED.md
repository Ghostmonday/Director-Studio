# ✅ GitHub Actions Workflows Fixed!

The workflow syntax errors have been corrected. Here's what was fixed:

## 🔧 Changes Made:

### 1. Fixed Secret Access in Conditions
**Before:**
```yaml
if: ${{ secrets.BUILD_CERTIFICATE_BASE64 != '' }}
```

**After:**
```yaml
if: env.BUILD_CERTIFICATE_BASE64 != ''
```

GitHub Actions doesn't allow direct secret access in `if:` conditions for security reasons.

### 2. Removed Unnecessary Secret Reference
Changed the TestFlight upload condition to only check branch, not secret availability.

### 3. Fixed Simple Workflow
Removed the secret reference from the simple build workflow since it's just for testing.

## 📝 About the Warnings:

The warnings about "Context access might be invalid" are **normal** - they just mean these secrets haven't been set up yet in your GitHub repository.

## 🔐 To Set Up Secrets (Optional):

If you want to enable automated builds with code signing:

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
3. Add these secrets:
   - `TEAM_ID` - Your Apple Developer Team ID
   - `BUILD_CERTIFICATE_BASE64` - Base64 encoded .p12 certificate
   - `P12_PASSWORD` - Password for the certificate
   - `KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD` - Any password for temporary keychain
   - `BUILD_PROVISION_PROFILE_BASE64` - Base64 encoded provisioning profile

But these are **not required** for local development!
