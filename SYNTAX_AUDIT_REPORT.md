# 🔍 DirectorStudio Codebase Syntax Audit Report

**Date:** October 24, 2025
**Status:** ✅ ALL CLEAR

## Summary

All core Swift files pass syntax validation. No blocking errors found.

## Files Audited

### ✅ Core Services
- **ContinuityManager.swift** - Clean ✓
  - 433 lines, properly structured
  - Two-stage continuity system (analyze + inject)
  - All brackets closed, no syntax errors
  
- **PipelineServiceBridge.swift** - Clean ✓
  - Proper integration with ContinuityManager
  - Both stages (continuityAnalysis, continuityInjection) properly referenced
  - Async/await syntax correct

### ✅ ViewModels & Views
- **PromptViewModel.swift** - Clean ✓
  - PipelineStage enum updated correctly
  - continuityAnalysis and continuityInjection cases added
  - All @Published properties properly typed
  
- **PromptView.swift** - Clean ✓
  - Image injection UI integrated
  - Video duration slider (3-20s) added
  - Error handling in place

### ✅ Models
- **GeneratedClip.swift** - Clean ✓
  - `isGeneratedFromImage` property added
  - `isFeaturedDemo` property added

## Cross-Reference Checks

✅ ContinuityAnalysis struct defined and used correctly
✅ PipelineStage enum updated in all locations
✅ ContinuityManager methods match call sites
✅ All imports present (Foundation, UIKit where needed)

## Build Status

**Xcode Project Build:** Ready
- Only blocking issue: Code signing (expected, user will configure)
- No syntax errors
- No missing symbols (once ContinuityManager.swift added to project)

## Action Items

1. ✅ Code syntax: COMPLETE
2. ⏳ Add ContinuityManager.swift to Xcode project
3. ⏳ Configure code signing
4. ⏳ Test build

## Continuity System Verification

✅ Two-stage pipeline correctly implemented:
   - Stage 1: `continuityAnalysis` → analyzeContinuity()
   - Stage 2: `continuityInjection` → injectContinuity()
   
✅ Analysis returns ContinuityAnalysis struct with:
   - isFirstClip: Bool
   - detectedElements: String
   - suggestedElements: [String]
   - continuityScore: Double

✅ Injection uses analysis results to enhance prompt

## Linter Results

No errors found in:
- DirectorStudio/Services/
- DirectorStudio/Features/
- DirectorStudio/Models/
- DirectorStudio/Components/

---

**Conclusion:** Codebase is syntax-clean and ready for build testing.
The only remaining step is adding ContinuityManager.swift to the Xcode project.
