## Credit Packages (Suggested)

```javascript
Starter:     $9.99  →  $10.00 credits
Standard:    $24.99 →  $27.00 credits (+$2 bonus)
Pro:         $47.99 →  $55.00 credits (+$5 bonus) ⭐ POPULAR
Enterprise:  $89.99 →  $115.00 credits (+$15 bonus)
```

What users can generate per package:
- **Starter ($9.99)**: 32 Basic 5sec OR 5 Premium 5sec
- **Pro ($47.99)**: 177 Basic 5sec OR 11 Premium 5sec
- **Enterprise ($89.99)**: 371 Basic 5sec OR 24 Premium 5sec

## Important Implementation Notes

### 1. Pre-charge Users
```javascript
// BEFORE calling Pollo API:
const cost = duration * tierPrice;
if (userBalance < cost) {
  return "Insufficient credits";
}
// Deduct immediately
userBalance -= cost;
```

### 2. Refund on Failure
```javascript
// In webhook handler:
if (status === 'failed') {
  userBalance += chargedAmount;
  sendRefundNotification();
}
```

### 3. Image Input Format
```javascript
// Option 1: Base64
"image": "data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABA..."

// Option 2: URL
"image": "https://yourcdn.com/image.jpg"
```

### 4. Polling (if not using webhooks)
```javascript
// Check status every 10 seconds
const pollStatus = async (taskId) => {
  while (true) {
    const status = await checkPolloStatus(taskId);
    if (status === 'succeed' || status === 'failed') {
      return status;
    }
    await sleep(10000); // 10 seconds
  }
};
```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Test each tier with text-only prompt
- [ ] Test each tier with image input
- [ ] Test insufficient credits handling
- [ ] Test webhook receives success
- [ ] Test webhook receives failure (triggers refund)
- [ ] Test 5-second generation cost calculation
- [ ] Test 10-second generation cost calculation
- [ ] Test credit purchase flow
- [ ] Verify profit margins are correct
- [ ] Test concurrent job submissions

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Don't forget webhook URL** - Videos won't return without it
2. **Don't use same seed** - Each generation needs unique seed
3. **Validate duration limits** - Basic max 8sec, others max 10sec
4. **Handle API timeouts** - Pollo can take 2-5 minutes
5. **Store taskId** - You need it to match webhook responses
6. **Charge upfront** - Never generate before payment
7. **Log everything** - Track costs for reconciliation
