üîß FIX APPLIED - YOU MUST REBUILD THE APP NOW
===============================================

The problem was: App was in "Guest Mode" which disables text input.

I changed it to allow text input without authentication.

BUT YOU NEED TO REBUILD:

STEP 1: Go to Xcode (should already be open)

STEP 2: Press ‚åò+R (or click the ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Play button)
        This rebuilds and restarts the app

STEP 3: Wait for app to launch on simulator

STEP 4: Now you should be able to click and type in the text fields!

===============================================

If it STILL doesn't work after rebuild:

1. In Xcode menu: Product ‚Üí Clean Build Folder (‚åò+Shift+K)
2. Then Product ‚Üí Run (‚åò+R)
3. Wait for fresh build

===============================================

The text field should now be ACTIVE and you can:
- Type in Project Name
- Type/Paste in the Prompt Text
- Click Add Reference Image
- Adjust Duration Slider
- Toggle Pipeline Stages
- Click Generate Clip

LET'S GO! üöÄ
