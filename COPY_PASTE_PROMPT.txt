Animate this mobile app screenshot with cinematic camera movements while preserving ALL UI elements and text clarity. Start with a gentle push-in centered on the text input field, hold for 2 seconds, then slowly pan down revealing the pipeline stage toggles. Add subtle zoom emphasizing the creative power. Professional gimbal-quality smooth movement. Warm inviting lighting (3200K-4500K), soft key light from top-left, subtle lens flares, 15% film grain for cinematic texture. Slight vignette to focus attention. Modern tech commercial color grade - slightly desaturated with lifted blacks. UI elements have subtle parallax depth. Gentle screen glow suggesting live interface. Very subtle floating particles (5% opacity) suggesting creativity. ALL text must remain 100% sharp and readable - no motion blur on UI elements. Maintain crisp edges on buttons and toggles. Style: Apple WWDC app reveal meets modern SaaS demo (Linear/Notion style). Professional, clean, inspiring. Tech commercial meets film production quality. Preserve UI contrast for accessibility. Mood: inspiring without cheesy, professional without cold, creative possibility, accessible power. This is where stories become cinema.


VOICEOVER STYLE (If you want it to feel like there's a narrator):
------------------------------------------------------------------

A cinematic reveal of DirectorStudio's main interface. Warm, inviting lighting highlights the text entry field where dreams become films. Smooth camera movement showcases the app's elegant design. An invisible narrator's words echo: "Just paste in your movie idea, screenplay, or favorite book, and watch as your story is transformed into prompts engineered to maintain continuity and add cinematography - so your generated videos can be combined to make your very own film, straight from Hollywood." Professional film production quality with subtle lens flares and depth of field. Modern tech commercial meets inspiring brand story.
