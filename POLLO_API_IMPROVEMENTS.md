# Pollo API Improvements

## Implementation Summary

Based on the best practices for Pollo API integration, the following improvements have been implemented:

### 1. Polling Strategy ✅
- **Changed from**: 5-second polling intervals
- **Changed to**: 2-second polling intervals (as recommended)
- **Benefit**: Faster response when videos are ready (40-50s typical processing time)

### 2. Retry Logic ✅
- **Changed from**: Simple 60 attempts with fixed delay
- **Changed to**: 30 retries with exponential backoff
- **Backoff**: Starts at 1 second, doubles on 503 errors (max 60s)
- **Benefit**: Better handling of service overload scenarios

### 3. Task ID Logging ✅
- **Location**: `~/Documents/pollo_tasks.log`
- **Format**: `ISO8601_timestamp TAB task_id TAB status`
- **Methods**:
  - `logTaskID()` - Records new tasks
  - `removeTaskID()` - Clears completed/failed tasks
  - `getPendingTasks()` - Retrieves unfinished tasks for recovery
- **Benefit**: Can resume from interruptions without losing progress

### 4. Error Handling ✅
- **503 Service Unavailable**: Special handling with exponential backoff
- **Network errors**: Proper retry logic
- **Benefit**: Graceful handling of temporary outages

### 5. Image-to-Video Chaining ✅
- **Feature**: Proper support for seed images
- **Implementation**: Base64 encoding of seed image in request
- **Duration**: Enforces 5-second clips for chaining
- **Benefit**: Enables visual continuity between clips

### 6. Duration Handling ✅
- **Max duration**: 5 seconds per clip
- **Chaining**: Ready for multi-clip generation for longer videos
- **Benefit**: Aligns with Pollo's optimal performance profile

## Usage Notes

1. **Processing Time**: Expect 40-50 seconds per clip on average
2. **Rate Limiting**: No hard cap, but use exponential backoff when hammering the API
3. **Recovery**: Check `getPendingTasks()` on app restart to resume interrupted generations
4. **Continuity**: Always pass the last frame as seed image for smooth transitions

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test with 5-second clips for optimal performance
2. Monitor the `pollo_tasks.log` file during generation
3. Test recovery by interrupting generation and restarting
4. Verify continuity by checking visual consistency between clips
